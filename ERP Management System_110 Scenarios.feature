  Then the system should demonstrate improved performance and response times

#Scenario 96: Horizontal Scalability
Scenario: Horizontal Scalability
  Given the ERP system is deployed across multiple servers
  When new servers are added to the cluster
  Then the system should distribute the load effectively and maintain performance


#4. Endurance Testing
#Endurance testing examines how the system performs over an extended period.

#Scenario 97: Long-Term Load Handling
Scenario: Long-Term Load Handling
  Given the ERP system is in a test environment
  When the system is subjected to continuous load for 24 hours
  Then the system should remain stable and responsive throughout the duration

#Scenario 98: Resource Utilization Over Time
Scenario: Resource Utilization Over Time
  Given the ERP system is under normal load
  When monitored over 48 hours
  Then CPU, memory, and disk usage should remain within acceptable thresholds

#5. Response Time Testing
#Response time testing measures how quickly the system responds to various requests.

#Scenario 99: Page Load Time
Scenario: Page Load Time
  Given a user is accessing the ERP system dashboard
  When the user requests the dashboard page
  Then the page should load within 3 seconds

#Scenario 100: Transaction Processing Time
Scenario: Transaction Processing Time
  Given a user is processing an order in the ERP system
  When the user submits the order
  Then the order processing should be completed within 5 seconds

#6. Throughput Testing
#Throughput testing measures how many transactions or operations the system can handle within a given time frame.

#Scenario 101: Transactions Per Minute
Scenario: Transactions Per Minute
  Given the ERP system is processing transactions
  When measured over a period of 10 minutes
  Then the system should handle at least 2,000 transactions per minute

#Scenario 102: Concurrent User Operations
Scenario: Concurrent User Operations
  Given multiple users are accessing the ERP system
  When 100 users perform simultaneous data entry operations
  Then the system should support all operations without significant delays

#7. Database Performance Testing
#Database performance testing assesses the efficiency of database operations and queries.

#Scenario 103: Query Performance
Scenario: Query Performance
  Given a complex report query is executed
  When the query runs against a production-sized database
  Then the query should complete within 10 seconds

#Scenario 104: Data Retrieval Speed
Scenario: Data Retrieval Speed
  Given a user is retrieving data from the ERP database
  When the user requests customer records
  Then the data should be retrieved and displayed within 2 seconds


#8. Network Performance Testing
#Network performance testing evaluates how network conditions affect ERP system performance.

#Scenario 105: Latency Impact
Scenario: Latency Impact
  Given the ERP system is accessed from a remote location
  When network latency is introduced (e.g., 100ms)
  Then the system should handle the latency without excessive impact on performance

#Scenario 106: Bandwidth Impact
Scenario: Bandwidth Impact
  Given the ERP system is accessed with limited bandwidth (e.g., 1 Mbps)
  When users perform typical operations
  Then the system should maintain acceptable performance levels


#Error Handling and Recovery Testing
#Error handling and recovery testing checks the system’s ability to handle and recover from errors.

#Scenario 107: System Failure Recovery
Scenario: System Failure Recovery
  Given the ERP system is experiencing a server failure
  When the system fails over to a backup server
  Then the system should recover with minimal downtime and without data loss

#Scenario 108: Transaction Rollback
Scenario: Transaction Rollback
  Given a transaction is in progress
  When an error occurs during the transaction
  Then the system should roll back the transaction and ensure data consistency


#User Experience Performance Testing
#User experience performance testing evaluates how performance affects the user experience.

#Scenario 109: Interactive Feature Performance
Scenario: Interactive Feature Performance
  Given a user is using interactive features like dashboards or real-time analytics
  When the user interacts with these features
  Then the features should respond promptly without lag

#Scenario 110: Mobile Performance
Scenario: Mobile Performance
  Given a user is accessing the ERP system on a mobile device
  When performing various tasks
  Then the mobile interface should perform well with no significant delays
